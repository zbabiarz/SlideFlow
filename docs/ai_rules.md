# AI Working Rules

1. **Progress Log Discipline**
   - After every session (any time work is completed and reported), append a dated entry to `docs/progress_log.md` that captures what changed, current status shifts, and next suggested steps.
2. **Document Integrity**
   - Treat existing documentation as append-only references: do not rewrite or delete prior content unless the user explicitly directs it. New facts belong in new sections/entries.
3. **Response Pattern for Status Requests**
   - When the user asks for updates or next steps, reply using this template:
     - `Progress:` one-line summary of what changed recently.
     - `Status:` concise statement of current system state/blockers.
     - `Next:` recommended immediate action(s), comma-separated.
4. **Initiative**
   - If ambiguities arise (new tasks, missing info), proactively ask clarifying questions and propose next actions rather than waiting for prompts.
