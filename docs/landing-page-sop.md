# Landing Page SOP

## CTAs
- Primary CTA text across the landing page must read exactly: `Start Free` (no arrows).
- Use `sf-btn-primary` for the primary CTA; secondary CTAs keep `sf-btn-secondary`.

## Hero
- Left column audience line color: `#a6a294`.
- Keep hero padding generous (`pt-32 md:pt-40`, `pb-24`); avoid forcing the right panel into a square when it would clip content.
- Right “Flow” panel: use the numbered steps layout with square icon tiles, contained within natural height (no `aspect-square`); number badges use color `#225561` and remain perfectly circular.

## Logos
- App logo served from `public/logo.png`; replace by overwriting that file only. Current asset size: `760×143`.

## Consistency checklist
- Verify all primary buttons on the page match the CTA copy above.
- Ensure icon containers are square and text uses the current sizing/colors from the hero flow mock.
- Remove or avoid reintroducing the mid-page features grid unless requested.***
