# What Is SlideFlow Studio?

SlideFlow Studio is the lightweight, AI‑assisted image editing workspace built directly inside SlideFlow. It is not a separate product—it is a core part of the SlideFlow experience, designed to prepare your images for high‑performing Instagram carousels with speed, simplicity, and clarity.

SlideFlow Studio gives creators, entrepreneurs, and teams a fast way to clean up images, adjust backgrounds, apply simple text overlays, and export Instagram‑ready visuals—all without ever opening a design tool.

## 1. Purpose and Positioning

SlideFlow Studio exists to remove the friction of image preparation. It sits between the moment you upload an image and the moment you assemble your carousel.

Where the main SlideFlow app handles:
- Carousel assembly
- Caption generation
- Scheduling and publishing
- Brand asset management

SlideFlow Studio handles one step earlier:
- Preparing clean, polished, platform‑optimized images suitable for carousels.

Studio focuses on **simple, controlled, and AI‑assisted editing**—not full graphic design. It is designed for users who need professional‑looking assets without complex tools.

## 2. Key Capabilities

### **2.1 Simple Image Adjustments**
SlideFlow Studio provides a fast workflow for essential adjustments:
- Cropping to Instagram‑optimized formats
- Rotating and straightening
- Resizing with built‑in 1:1 and 4:5 presets
- Exporting clean PNGs ready for carousels

These tools keep editing focused and efficient.

### **2.2 AI Background Tools**
Studio includes an AI background system designed specifically for social media assets. Studio can:
- Remove full backgrounds while isolating the main subject
- Replace backgrounds with solid brand colors
- Replace backgrounds with gradients
- Place subjects onto new background images

This gives users a professional “cut‑out” look without manual masking or complex editing.

### **2.3 AI‑Assisted Text Overlay**
SlideFlow Studio allows users to apply short text overlays using:
- User‑typed text
- AI‑generated text (when guidance is preferred)

Placement is programmatic and AI‑assisted:
- The system finds safe zones and visually balanced positions
- Text is applied using precise colors the user selects

This light overlay system is perfect for titles, hooks, and product labels.

### **2.4 Export Back to SlideFlow**
Once editing is complete, users export their final PNG directly into their SlideFlow media library. The new asset becomes available immediately inside:
- The carousel builder
- The caption generator
- Any existing or new SlideFlow workflow

SlideFlow Studio is fully integrated and requires no extra tools.

- Inpainting or outpainting
- AI image generation from text prompts
- Complex typography systems or multi‑layer text layouts
